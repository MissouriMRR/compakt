<h1 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top:-1ch">The Compakt app is a tool designed by the Multirotor Software Division <br>
	to assist with drone testing days by providing data logging and retrieval <br>
	capabilities for flight data, among other useful features.</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 35px; margin-top:5ch">How is it used?</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top:-1ch">There are two main pages you will need to navigate between, The Flight Recorder and the Flight Logs <br>
	The Flight Recorder does exactly what the name suggests, that is where you will go to enter information and record your flight.<br>
	Once a flight has been recorded, that information will be stored within the app, where it can be viewed in the Flight Logs. <br>
	From there, you can view, manage, and export any previously recorded flight logs <br>
